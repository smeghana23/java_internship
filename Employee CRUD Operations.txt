Pure Object Oriented Language or Complete Object Oriented Language are Fully Object Oriented Language that supports or have features that treats everything inside the program as objects. It doesnâ€™t support primitive datatype(like int, char, float, bool, etc.).

java archide - jre
JDBC drivers convert JDBC API calls into database API calls







Layered Architecture
1. Bean/Entity Layer - Contains Java beans
2. Data Access Objects - contains classes that performs
			- CRUD operations on database
3. Helper Layer - Contains class that connects to database doesn't require bean
4. Service layer - Receives requests from UI and sends to DAO and vice versa - business logics are implemented. Which will have business logic
5. Presentation layer - All User Interface operations which will have data input and data display.

presentation <-> service <-> DAO <-> DB server

		           Helper - create and close connection both the connections are static

Beans are used in presentation, DAO and service layer
